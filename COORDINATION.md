## Integration Log

| Timestamp (UTC) | Session | Action |
|-----------------|---------|--------|
| 2026-11-02 07:?? | ccb3febc-korea4 | Repo reviewed (only # Korea4), created task board, verified 2026-2029 availability, computed windows, built `site/` (6 pages) + `docs/` (4 md), PR #1 merged to main (530af53). Finding: no 7/14/21-day window 2027-2029 — best 4 days Feb 15-18 2027 verified anchors. |
| 2026-11-02 17:17 | arena/c697ef7b-korea4 | Created separate task board (no competing sessions detected at that time due to fetch lag), verified 2026 MLB/NFL/Cal/Stanford via search, estimated 2027-2029 windows as 14-day Feb gaps, built root `index.html` dashboard + `assets/` + `data/` + `site/pages/` (11 pages), PR #2 opened. |
| 2026-11-02 17:22 | integration | Detected parallel work (both from a6e22c4, conflicting). Merging PR #2 into main that already contains PR #1. No work discarded — both sites kept. |
| 2026-11-02 17:25 | integration | Conflicts in COORDINATION.md, README.md, index.html resolved by merging. Preserved other session's verified anchors (2027 SB Feb 14, spring Feb 19, MLB Mar 25) as they are newer (Jul 16 2026 MLB press releases). Updated vacation windows: 2026 14-day still stands, but 2027-2029 corrected to ~4-day gaps (not 14). Both flag sets unified. |
| 2026-11-02 17:25 | integration | Build check: local http.server smoke test 200 OK, link checker 0 broken. Pages source = main:/ legacy — index.html at root + site/ both served. |

## Unified Task Board

| # | Task | Status | Owner | Files | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|-------|-------|
| 1 | Coordination board + repo review | done | both | COORDINATION.md | Merged — see log |
| 2 | Verify official schedule availability 2026-2029 | done | both | `docs/sources.md`, `site/pages/sources.html`, `site/sources.html`, `data/*.json` | Other session verified 2027 anchors via MLB press releases Jul 16 2026 (more recent); this session verified 2026 via MLB Aug 26 2025 + 49ers/NFL. Combined = full 2026+2027 verified, 2028/29 est. |
| 3 | Estimate game durations | done | both | `docs/durations.md`, `data/game-durations.json`, methodology | Consolidated: MLB 2:38 (official) + 2:48-3:10 variants; NFL 3:12, NCAAF 3:24-3:27 — flagged where secondary. |
| 4 | Compute vacation windows 2027/2028/2029 | done (reconciled) | both | `docs/vacation-windows.md`, `site/vacation.html`, `site/pages/vacation-windows.html`, `data/vacation-windows.json` | **Reconciled finding:** 2026 14-day (Feb 9-22) verified still valid. 2027: 4 days Feb 15-18 verified (SB Feb 14 → spring Feb 19). Earlier 14-day est for 2027 was wrong — corrected. 2028/2029: ~4-5 days est. No 7/14/21-day window 2027-2029 strict definition — confirmed by both. |
| 5 | SF Bay Area radio availability (94122) | done | both | `docs/radio.md`, `site/radio.html`, `site/pages/radio-guide.html`, `data/radio-guide.json` | Unified: KNBR 680/104.5, KGO 810, KNEW 960/KSTE 650, Stanford KZSU marginal — both sessions agree. |
| 6 | Build GitHub Pages site | done | both | `index.html` + `assets/` + `site/` + `site/pages/` + `docs/` | Root dashboard (this session) + legacy site/ (other session) + docs/ all kept. Pages served from `main:/`. |
| 7 | Final integration: line-by-line re-verify, build check, PR + merge, Pages deploy | in progress | arena/c697ef7b-korea4 | all | This merge — build check passed, PR #2 conflicting resolved, will merge after verification. |

## Rules (from both sessions)

- Every table row needs an official source link. Unconfirmable = blank + UNVERIFIED/ESTIMATED flag, published on Flagged for Review page. Never infer.
- Estimated schedules (unreleased years) must be labelled ESTIMATED, never presented as verified.
- Shared outputs are changed only by final integration; this merge is that integration.

## Flagged items unified

- This session flagged 5 items (Week 18 TBD, TBD kick times, WW1 affiliate ambiguity, 2027-2029 est, duration variance).
- Other session flagged 12 items (F1-F12: 2028 All-Star exact date conflict, SB LXIII date blank, 2028/29 unreleased, Jul 15 resumption unverified, duration estimates, dated Stanford/Cal flagship contracts, reception untested, 2028 break, full game-by-game impossibility, local WW1 carriage, prior sites).
- All preserved — see `site/pages/flagged.html` + `site/flagged.html` + `docs/flagged.md` (19 unique flags total).

## Handoff note

> Parallel sessions both did legitimate greenfield work from same initial commit. Per instructions, no work was discarded on merge conflict — both sites kept and findings reconciled (2027 4-day corrected). Log here instead of editing other session's owned files beyond merge resolution.

## Next: publish

- Merge PR #2 to main, confirm Pages deploy succeeds (main:/), record PR link + deploy result below.
- PR #2: https://github.com/karagemop466-tech/Korea4/pull/2 — state OPEN, mergeable CONFLICTING (now resolved locally)
- After local merge, push to main or merge via gh.

## Log

- 2026-11-02: Session started. Setting up coordination and beginning research.


**Integration notes for cab47657:**
- Built flat site at root: `index.html`, `calendar.html`, `daily.html`, `vacation.html`, `teams.html`, `radio.html`, `executive-summary.html`, `flagged.html` with `css/style.css`, `js/app.js`
- Data: `data/schedules.js` (691 lines) — verified 2026 49ers (18 weeks via nfl.com), Stanford (gostanford.com), Cal (calbears.com), Westwood One (westwoodonesports.com) with 30+ verified rows, durations (MLB 158 min official, NFL 192, NCAAF 206), season windows 2027-2029 estimated, Bay Area radio table.
- Also built legacy `site/` (other session) — now all three site trees coexist.
- Merged without discarding — see `git log --graph`.
- No verification discarded; `data/schedules.js` is additional authoritative source for 2026 line-by-line verification (complements `data/*.json` + `docs/sources.md`).

**Unified next:** merge this PR #2 (already reconciled 4-day finding) — final integration will re-verify combined data, confirm build, merge to main, deploy Pages (now via `pages.yml` workflow + legacy).

## Additional Parallel Session: arena-97161ae7 (merged via this merge, PR #7)

> **Branch:** `arena/97161ae7-korea4` · **Started:** 2026-11-02 from the same initial commit `a6e22c4`.
> This session began before it could see the other sessions' work (its checkout contained only the stub
> README), so it independently created its own task board and rebuilt the project from official sources.
> On discovering PRs #1–#5 already merged to `main`, it merged `main` in and reconciled — no work from
> any session is discarded. This session's site tree is **`docs/` (HTML scoreboard edition)**; it coexists
> with the root dashboard, `site/`, `site/pages/` and the flat root pages exactly like the earlier trees.

### What this session built (all under `docs/` unless noted)
- `docs/index.html` dashboard + executive summary (also `EXECUTIVE-SUMMARY.md` at repo root)
- `docs/calendar.html` — day-by-day Free-Time Scoreboard Nov 2, 2026 → Dec 31, 2029 (prev/next day,
  month grid, per-day free windows 6 AM–midnight PT) powered by `docs/data.js` + `docs/app.js`
- `docs/vacation.html` — ranked windows with live-computed streaks + least-conflict 7/14/21-day windows
  for 2027/2028/2029, plus toggles for "All Bay Area radio sports" and the conditional 2028 Olympic break
- `docs/mlb.html`, `docs/football.html` (NFL/49ers/Stanford/Cal), `docs/westwood.html` (complete
  Westwood One 2026 NFL broadcast list in PT, ~50 games captured 2026-11-02), `docs/radio.html` (94122
  station map), `docs/flagged.html` (this session's F-1…F-15)
- `research-notes.md` (methods + full source list) and `tools/test-engine.cjs` (engine assertions)

### Refinement (consistent with the reconciled headline finding — adds precision, changes nothing)
- Day-by-day computation confirms **no 7/14/21-day strict window exists in 2027–2029**.
- It adds that the longest fully-free stretches are **6-day weekday corridors** in the late-Jan→mid-Feb
  NFL-playoff seams (2027: Jan 25–30, Feb 1–6, Feb 8–13). These rest on *unannounced* playoff dates, so
  they are ESTIMATES; **Feb 15–18, 2027 remains the best window verified on both sides** (SB LXI Feb 14;
  spring games Feb 19) — same anchor set the earlier sessions used.
- Conditional best window flagged: **Jul 12–20, 2028 (9 days)** *if* MLB finalizes its envisioned extended
  Olympic break (LA28 Jul 14–30, 2028; ASG at Oracle Park ~Jul 11, host announced Aug 2026; break not
  agreed with MLBPA as of Jul-2026 reporting). Earlier sessions also flagged the 2028 break (F1-F12 set);
  this session models it as an explicit opt-in scenario in the scoreboard engine.
- Verification by this session: official sources only (mlb.com 2027 release of Jul 16, 2026;
  westwoodonesports.com full schedule capture; nfl.com/49ers.com; calbears.com official schedule fetch;
  gostanford.com — its /schedule/2026 deep link 404s, cross-verified instead, flagged F-14 in
  `docs/flagged.html`). Durations: MLB 2:38 (MLB official), NFL ~3:03 timing study / 3:12 broadcast
  compilations → modeled 3:10, NCAAF 3:26 — consistent with other sessions' consolidated values.
- Tests run before merge: engine assertions 9/9 PASS (all 1,156 model days compute); jsdom render test
  8/8 pages PASS with zero JS errors; internal link check 0 broken. Full log in `research-notes.md`.

### This session's original task board (for audit)
Tasks 1–9 done (coordination, anchors, radio map, durations, vacation analysis, scoreboard site, exec
summary, flagged page, verification pass); Task 10 (PR + merge + Pages) = this merge (**PR #7**).
Merge conflicts in `COORDINATION.md` and `README.md` were resolved by keeping `main`'s integrated
documents as the base and appending/inserting this session's sections — nothing deleted from any session.

### Follow-up
- After PR #7 merges, a tiny follow-up PR from `arena/97161ae7-korea4` will append the merge + Pages
  deploy result here (this session may only push to its own branch).
- Suggested future session: pick ONE daily tree as the primary UX and cross-link the rest (repo now has
  four coexisting site trees: root, `site/`, `site/pages/`, `docs/` HTML; all valid, findings agree).
